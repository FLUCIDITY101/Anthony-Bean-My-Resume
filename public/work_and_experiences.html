        we work within various broadcast specifications to quaility-check and create master files for 
        broadcast. I have grasped the more customary skills however, I'm missing skills like QCs and 
        Pre-grades.

                    <li>My Tropical Romance S1</li>

        <p>I am responsible for capturing feeds from multiple streams, grouping and archiving the rushes for post. We also receive 
        numerous formats from PSC, applying the same workflow and keeping a detailed log of everything. At request, laying down 
        scenes for review as well as small cuts used for props on-screen. Problem solving is also a key part of prodution, monitoring

        <h2>Edit Support Operator</h2>
            <h3>- Evolutions.tv (March 2021 to March 2023) - </h3>
        <p>This role opened up my skillset as I developed more timeline skills. My duties consisted of exports for review, EDLs, 
        and assembling syncmaps using multiple formats. Reliable suite support was necessary, whether it be Avid, remote, or hardware issues. 
        I progressed into a senior position and the infrequent jobs started to fall on me, such as consolidating generics for end-of-project 
        as well as tasks where technical knowledge was required to solve issues. Final Sequence consolidations for delivery were also our 
        responsibility. Looking back, it's evident I grew the most during this period. 
        </p>

        <h2>Media Support Operator</h2>
            <h3>- Evolutions.tv (Nov 2019 to Dec 2020) - </h3>
        <p>After 8 weeks of Running and shadowing, I got the opportunity to work in the MCR. It was always my goal to join the Operations team. 
        Ingest, drive copies, and archiving were the bulk of my work. Knowledge of video and audio codecs is vital because each project has an 
        Ingest specification and native conversion may be needed. Writing LTOs for project backups was also a main duty; we used a Xendata system 
        to do this. 
        </p>
        <h4>Core Skills:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Copies - (Hard Drives & QNAPs containing Native Rushes, Avid MediaFiles inc. rescanning)</li>
            <li>Identifying Formats - (Codecs and Wrappers, Using Mediainfo to determine format)</li>
            <li>Avid Ingest - (Working to guidelines: Native, 4: I, Proxies)</li>
            <li>Archiving - (Writing to & Extracting from LTOs using Xendata, SONA)</li>
            <li>Media Conversion - (Taking into account: Bitrate, Scan type, Bit depth, Colour Profiles)</li>

        <h2>Runner</h2>
            <h3>- Evolutions.tv (Sept 2019 to Nov 2019) - </h3>
        <p>My main duties as a Runner were attending to Clients, Staff or any other visitor to help their day run smoother. Completing runs to other 
        buildings, carrying drives, documents etc. Being a runner at Evo's means you are really integrated into other departments, covering for 
        colleagues when they aren't available, juggling jobs simultaneously and just getting to know clients and staff.
